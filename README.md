# audio-analyzer
this software i made as a final work for a course called system programming.
the software makes a spectrum analyzer and scope for audio input. 
it is writen in c language on the NI CVI developmant environment.

at the moment it is opening the defualt audio device 
but the plan is to make it possible to open device of user choice. 

the code uses portaudio open source lib as the audio api
and cvi builtin functions for the signal processing and user interface parts of the soft.

for requests or questions you are welcome to contact me.
i hope you'l enjoy making use of it.
