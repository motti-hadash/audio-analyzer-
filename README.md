# audio-analyzer
this software i made as a final work for a course called system programming
it is a spectrum analyzer and scope for audio input from the computer microphone 
implemented in c language in the NI CVI developmant environment.

at the moment it is opening only the defualt audio device 
in the future i plan to make it possible to open device of user choice 

the code uses portaudio open source lib as the audio api
and cvi builtin functions for the signal processing.
